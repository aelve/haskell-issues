# Haskell issues

This is like [this unofficial Github issue tracker](https://github.com/isaacs/github), but for Haskell and all Haskell-related things (Cabal, Stack, standard libraries, etc etc etc).

**Post your half-baked ideas here and somebody else will take care of them.** Examples:

* You spotted a bug in documentation and don't know where to file it
* GHC gives a weird error message and you don't know how to use GHC Trac
* You have an idea for Cabal but don't know whether one of a myriad open Cabal issues already deals with it
* You just think it would be nice to have a library that does X
